# 🏺 Can MCS distinguish modern cement from traditional mineral mortar?
#
# Modern Portland cement has higher density and different
# elemental composition compared to traditional mineral
# mortars used historically (quartz + calcite mixtures).
# If MCS can detect this difference, it may serve as a
# non-destructive authentication tool for archaeological artifacts.
