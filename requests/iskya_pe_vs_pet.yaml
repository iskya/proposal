# ♻️ Can MCS distinguish PE from PET?
#
# Polyethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
# are widely used plastics in packaging and industry.
# Although both are carbon-based polymers, PET contains
# oxygen and has higher density, leading to a shorter
# radiation length (X0).
#
# If Multiple Coulomb Scattering can separate them,
# this could provide a non-destructive method for
# plastic identification and recycling classification.
