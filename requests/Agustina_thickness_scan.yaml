# 📏 How does scattering scale with thickness for different material classes?
#
# This analysis studies how Multiple Coulomb Scattering (MCS)
# scales with material thickness for three representative classes:
# an organic polymer (PMMA), a chlorinated plastic (PVC),
# and an inorganic mineral (quartz).
#
# According to the Highland formula:
#
#    θ₀ ∝ √(x / X₀)
#
# angular dispersion should increase with the square root of thickness,
# with different slopes depending on radiation length (X₀).
